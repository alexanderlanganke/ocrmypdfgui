summary: Hobby Project GUI for the Python Program "OCRmyPDF" by James R. Barlow
description: |
  I use James R. Barlow's OCRmyPDF heavily in my paperless Office and have created this Python Project as a GUI wrapper to run batch jobs on my filesystem. This is strictly a Hobby Project and is not "official". Feel free to use it if you like. Includes full current version of OCRmyPDF as backend. Icons and banner made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com
